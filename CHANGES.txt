TBD

- Change template to use "--logged-array" rather than the older
  "--log-10-array"

1.0.4

- Update template scripts and configuration files to include
  missing parameters that were referenced in the project
  documentation and prostate example ("use-feature-selection-fold"
  for example).

1.0.3

- "Survival" mode option was not being set properly and caused
  the ExecuteSplits mode to fail when generating statistics.

- The correct name for the prostate example test split is
  now set to GSE8402-FusionYesNo-TestSplit.cids.

- The "predict-validation" target now sets the required attribute
  "model-directory" properly.

1.0.2

- Set the properties for "use-feature-selection-fold" to true in
  the  prostate-example.xml file. When these are not defined, the
  prostate example doesn't produce any results.

- Improve error handling in the "compound file" code used to store
  results.

1.0.1

- Fixed a crash due to missing class "ProgressLogger".
  See http://icbtools.med.cornell.edu/mantis/view.php?id=1314

- Updated icb-utils.jar to version icb-utils-144.  Previously
  included version included duplicate but older CompoundFile code.

1.0

- First release.
